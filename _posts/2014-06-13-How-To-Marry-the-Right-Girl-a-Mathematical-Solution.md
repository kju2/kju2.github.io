title: How To Marry The Right Girl - A Mathematical Solution
---
I heard about the marriage or secretary problem some time ago. I don't know where and when, but the problem and the solution I remember. It stuck because it is practical and the solution is so simple and elegant.

The best explanation I have found so far is: [How To Marry The Right Girl: A Mathematical Solution](http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2014/05/15/312537965/how-to-marry-the-right-girl-a-mathematical-solutio)

And if you want to know more the mathematician also have a serious name for this problem: [optimal stopping theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_stopping).
