title: 21C Workplace Skills and L&D

Our school system was developed to give a lot of people the basic knowledge they needed to work in factories. And it brought us far. 

But the times have changed and now we don't need that many factory workers anymore. We need knowledge workers. And knowledge workers need a different kind of education. The skills they need is not what they learn in school today.

Luckily a lot of people have been thinking about this problem and raised awareness, developed strategies and made their findings publicly available, e.g. Sir Ken Robinson TED talks. They are amazing! Funny and full of knowledge. [How schools kill creativity](https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity)

> If you are not prepared to be wrong, you will never come up with anything original!

And then I recently discovered the blogs of [Harold Jarche](http://www.jarche.com) and [Sahana Chattopadhyay](http://idreflections.blogspot.co.at)

The post [21C Workplace Skills and L&D](http://idreflections.blogspot.co.at/2014/07/21c-workplace-skills-and-l.html) collects some special insights from several sources. So make sure to read it, if you want to know what skills are needed today and in the future.

And at last a "joke" people in training and development tell:

> CFO asks CEO: "What happens if we invest in developing our people & then they leave us?"
>
> CEO: "What happens if we don't, and they stay?"

Some accredit this to Shaun Mayfield, but I don't know for sure who said this. But it still is so true!
