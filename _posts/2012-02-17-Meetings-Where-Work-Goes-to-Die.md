title: Meetings - Where Work Goes to Die
---

Meetings - where work goes to die. That isn't necessarily true for all meetings, but for a lot I have attended. I agree with all suggestions from Jeff Atwood:

* Meetings should be short (< 1 hour).
* A clear purpose is defined beforehand. 
* If you have to prepare something for the meeting, do it before the meeting.
* Attendance is optional, so go to the meeting only if you want or need to.
* At the end of the meeting everyone summarizes her/his to-dos, because the goal of meetings is to make decisions (or inform you about made decisions), so you can get stuff done.
