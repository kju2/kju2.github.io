title: GoTo Considered Harmful
---

"Goto Statement Considered Harmful." by E.W. Dijkstra influenced many modern programming languages we use today. GOTO is (almost) a thing of the past. But at the time of publishing the world was different. Read what the reviewer of the article thought! 

On the site the author gathered more reviews to "crazy" ideas like relational databases, Turing machines and public-key crypto-systems. In retrospect, they are hilarious.
